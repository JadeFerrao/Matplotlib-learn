# Introduction to Matplotlib  

Matplotlib is a Python library that allows you to create high-quality visualizations, such as line plots, bar charts, scatter plots, histograms, and more. It provides a flexible and intuitive interface for creating static, animated, and interactive plots, making it an essential tool for data visualization and analysis.

# Installation

Before you can start using Matplotlib, you need to install it. You can do this using pip, the Python package manager:

bash `pip install matplotlib`
